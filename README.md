Keyboard layout for Ru/En typing. Based on fully optimized QGMLWB layout (http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization).

## For Windows
Download and unpack archives with Russian and English languages, then run .еxe files. Make layouts basic for input in both languages in the settings.

## For Mac
Just run dmg file. Make layouts basic for input in both languages in the settings.
